## Testing

### System tests

**Windows**

1. Open a DOS window in the `test` folder
2. Run the `runtests.bat` script
3. If the script reports that there is no difference between `actual.txt` and `expected.txt`, 
   the test has passed.

**Mac/Unix/Linux**

1. Open a terminal window in the `test` folder
2. Run the `runtests.sh` script
3. If the script reports that there is no difference between `actual.txt` and `expected.txt`, 
   the test has passed.

### User stories
1. As a user, I want to set priority of contact information in the address book so that the people with the highest priority will be shown at the top.

### Use case
Title: "renaming of an existing tag"
Actor: User
MSS:
1. User enters renameTag command in the command line
2. Address book requests for contact name.
3. User enters contact name.
4. Address book requests for new tag.
5. User enters new tag.
6. Address book change the existing tag to the new tag. 
Extensions:
3. User enters wrong name.
    Address book goes back to step 1
Use case ends

### JUnit tests

* In Eclipse, right-click on the `test/java` folder and choose `Run as` > `JUnit Test`

### Troubleshooting test failures

* Problem: How do I examine the exact differences between `actual.txt` and `expected.txt`?<br>
  Solution: You can use a diff/merge tool with a GUI e.g. WinMerge (on Windows)
* Problem: The two files look exactly the same, but the test script reports they are different.<br>
  Solution: This can happen because the line endings used by Windows is different from Unix-based
  OSes. Convert the actual.txt to the format used by your OS using some [utility](https://kb.iu.edu/d/acux).
* Problem: Test fails during the very first time.<br>
  Solution: The output of the very first test run could be slightly different because the program
  creates a new storage file. Tests should pass from the 2nd run onwards.
